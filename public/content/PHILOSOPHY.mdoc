## The Code is Truth

We believe in shipping. Code is the ultimate truth.
Everything else is just noise.

### Principles

1.  **Velocity**: Speed in execution leads to faster learning.
2.  **Simplicity**: Complexity is the enemy of execution.
3.  **Utility**: If it's not useful, it shouldn't exist.
